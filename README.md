# Transcrobes
Transcrobes is the central project for the Transcrobes project (https://transcrob.es) and houses the central API for interacting with the system.

Applications with independent lifecycles (web extensions, media player plugins, the SRS system, etc.) live in other repositories in the project group (also called transcrobes).

As the nexus point for the project, it contains various cross-concern elements and serves to house issues and discussions that don't clearly belong to one of the other sub-projects, in addition to the central API.

Status

This is PRE-alpha software with KNOWN DATALOSS BUGS. It works, sorta, if you hold it right. There are not yet any tests and you should not attempt to use this project for anything like "production" until at least tests have been added.

Configuration

Development
===========
If you are a (Python) developer learning Chinese, or you really want this to be compatible with learning other languages then your help is needed!
